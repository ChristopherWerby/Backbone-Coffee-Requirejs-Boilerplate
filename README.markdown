# Backbone Boilerplate

Setting up Backbone projects that use Require, Handlebars and Coffeescript made easy.

## Dependancies
There are a ton. We need to write a one-liner install, but these are the major ones:
- Ruby
- [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/#installation)
- [Compass & SASS](http://compass-style.org/install/)
- [Node (used for r.js build)](http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs)
