# Backbone Boilerplate

Setting up Backbone projects that use Require, Handlebars and Coffeescript made easy.

At the moment the transition from learning Backbone to using it in a real-world app is too hard. The aim of this boilerplate is to make it easier, and work towards something approximating best practices. Contributions encouraged!

## Dependancies
There are a ton. We need to write a one-liner install, but these are the major ones:
- [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/#installation) Simply tell coffeescript to watch /coffee and compile to /public/js
- [Compass & SASS](http://compass-style.org/install/)
- [Node (used for r.js build)](http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs)
